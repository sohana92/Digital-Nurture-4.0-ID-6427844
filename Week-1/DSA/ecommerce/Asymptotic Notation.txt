Understanding Asymptotic Notation (Big O):

Big O notation describes how an algorithm's performance scales with input size, focusing on the worst-case scenario:

O(1): Constant time (instant)

O(log n): Logarithmic time (very fast)

O(n): Linear time (proportional to input size)

O(nÂ²): Quadratic time (slows quickly with large inputs)

Search Operation Scenarios
Best case: Item is found immediately (first element for linear, middle for binary)

Average case: Item is found after checking half the elements (linear) or log(n) elements (binary)

Worst case: Item is last checked (linear) or doesn't exist (both)
