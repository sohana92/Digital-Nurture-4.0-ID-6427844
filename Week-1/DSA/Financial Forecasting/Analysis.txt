Time Complexity:
Recursive: O(n) — one call per year

Memoized: O(n) — but avoids recomputation (good for variations or if reused)

Optimization Tips:
Use memoization or iterative approach to avoid stack overflows or repeated work

For large n, prefer loops or even closed-form solutions (e.g., Math.pow())
