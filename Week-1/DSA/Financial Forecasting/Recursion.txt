Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It simplifies problems that can be broken down into identical subproblems.

Key characteristics:

Base case (stopping condition)

Recursive case (function calls itself)

Progress toward base case

For financial forecasting, recursion is useful for:

Compound growth calculations

Time-series predictions

Multi-period forecasting
